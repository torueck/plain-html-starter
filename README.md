# Plain Html Starter

This is a very basic web application that utilizes semantic HTML and progressive enhancement. It provides good accessibility and works without JS enabled.

This is based on the excellent [write-up of Jason Knight](https://medium.com/codex/progressive-enhancement-accessible-web-design-on-a-silver-platter-241ab262284b).

- `./step1-plain-text` - contains the content that should go to the page as plain text.
- `./step2-base-markup` - contains the basic layout of the content, without any styling. Nice? no; usable? of course.
